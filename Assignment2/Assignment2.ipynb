    "This dataset is for a marketing company to analyze the impact of advertising campaigns. It captures the details of individuals exposed to either a specific advertisement or a public service announcement. The dataset provides insights into whether the campaign led to a conversion, the number of ads seen by the individual, and details about the most active day and hour.\n",

    "#### **Data Collection**:\n",
    "The dataset is from kaggle: [Marketing A/B Testing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing/). The data is collected from randomized experiments wherein two versions of a webpage element (advertisement or public service announcement) are shown to different segments of the audience.\n",
